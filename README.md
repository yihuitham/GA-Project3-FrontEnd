## User Stories
Go to ./public/GA_Project3 - User stories.docx of this repository folder.

## General Approach to Challenges
- Break down a function into a very simple function (i.e. logging out a string on the console) and incrementally build towards the main function.

## Unsolved Problems
- Display marks on staff's calender to indicate the dates where he/she is assigned an operation
- Prevent double booking of staffs on the same date and time

## Stretch Goals
- Chat feature that would allow communication within the operation team
- To breakdown operation schedules in terms of timeslots

## Backend
The backend files can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/yihuitham/GA-Project3-BackEnd)
